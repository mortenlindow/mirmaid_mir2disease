Enforced expression of the miR-200 family alone was sufficient to prevent TGF-beta-induced EMT. Together, these microRNAs cooperatively regulate expression of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 (also known as deltaEF1) and SIP1 (also known as ZEB2), factors previously implicated in EMT and tumour metastasis. Inhibition of the microRNAs was sufficient to induce EMT in a process requiring upregulation of ZEB1 and/or SIP1. Conversely, ectopic expression of these microRNAs in mesenchymal cells initiated mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). Consistent with their role in regulating EMT, expression of these microRNAs was found to be lost in invasive breast cancer cell lines with mesenchymal phenotype. Expression of the miR-200 family was also lost in regions of metaplastic breast cancer specimens lacking E-cadherin. These data suggest that downregulation of the microRNAs may be an important step in tumour progression."

Enforced expression of the miR-200 family alone was sufficient to prevent TGF-beta-induced EMT. Together, these microRNAs cooperatively regulate expression of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 (also known as deltaEF1) and SIP1 (also known as ZEB2), factors previously implicated in EMT and tumour metastasis. Inhibition of the microRNAs was sufficient to induce EMT in a process requiring upregulation of ZEB1 and/or SIP1. Conversely, ectopic expression of these microRNAs in mesenchymal cells initiated mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). Consistent with their role in regulating EMT, expression of these microRNAs was found to be lost in invasive breast cancer cell lines with mesenchymal phenotype. Expression of the miR-200 family was also lost in regions of metaplastic breast cancer specimens lacking E-cadherin. These data suggest that downregulation of the microRNAs may be an important step in tumour progression."

Enforced expression of the miR-200 family alone was sufficient to prevent TGF-beta-induced EMT. Together, these microRNAs cooperatively regulate expression of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 (also known as deltaEF1) and SIP1 (also known as ZEB2), factors previously implicated in EMT and tumour metastasis. Inhibition of the microRNAs was sufficient to induce EMT in a process requiring upregulation of ZEB1 and/or SIP1. Conversely, ectopic expression of these microRNAs in mesenchymal cells initiated mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). Consistent with their role in regulating EMT, expression of these microRNAs was found to be lost in invasive breast cancer cell lines with mesenchymal phenotype. Expression of the miR-200 family was also lost in regions of metaplastic breast cancer specimens lacking E-cadherin. These data suggest that downregulation of the microRNAs may be an important step in tumour progression."

Enforced miR-211 expression significantly increased the proliferation, migration, and anchorage-independent colony formation of oral carcinoma cells, while it enhanced the tumorigenicity of only SAS high-grade oral carcinoma cells, but not OECM-1 non-tumorigenic cells.

Furthermore, we found that overexpression of miR-141 and miR-200c caused down-regulation of ZFHX1B and up-regulation of E-cadherin in two renal carcinoma cell lines, ACHN and 786-O.

TaqMan analysis of paired tumor/normal samples revealed 1.5- to 2.6-fold overexpression of polymorphic miR-146a* in 7 of 8 tumors compared with the unaffected part of the same gland. The microarray data showed that widely different transcriptomes occurred in the tumors and in unaffected parts of the thyroid from GC and GG patients. The modulated genes are mainly involved in regulation of apoptosis leading to exaggerated DNA-damage response in heterozygotes potentially explaining the predisposition to cancer. We propose that contrary to previously held views transcripts from the passenger strand of miRs can profoundly affect the downstream effects. Heterozygosity for polymorphisms within the premiR sequence can cause epistasis through the production of additional mature miRs.

This is the first example of a miRNA negatively regulating another to maintain levels of a target protein. Interfering with miR-205 function by using a synthetic antagomir, or by the ectopic expression of miR-184, leads to a coordinated damping of the Akt signaling pathway via SHIP2 induction. This was associated with a marked increase in keratinocyte apoptosis and cell death. Aggressive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells exhibited elevated levels of miR-205. This was associated with a concomitant reduction in SHIP2 levels. Partial knockdown of endogenous miR-205 in SCCs markedly decreased phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated BAD levels and increased apoptosis. We were able to increase SHIP2 levels in SCC cells after inhibition of miR-205. Therefore, miR-205 might have diagnostic value in determining the aggressivity of SCCs.

Taken together, miR-21 may be important in the initiation and progression of gastric cancers as an oncomiR, likely through regulating RECK.

Cell culture experiments indicate that enforced miR-320 expression can suppress TfR-1 expression and cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: TPA induces the expression of several miRNAs in HL-60 cells, one such miRNA (miR-320) contributes to downregulation of TfR-1 surface expression characteristically seen during HL-60 monocytic differentiation.

Consistent with an impairment of miRNA-mediated regulation of BACE1 expression, these findings prompted us to investigate the regulatory role of the BACE1 3'-UTR element and the possible involvement of specific miRNAs in cultured neuronal (N2a) and fibroblastic (NIH 3T3) cells. Through various experimental approaches, we validated computational predictions and demonstrated that miR-298 and miR-328 recognize specific binding sites in the 3'-UTR of BACE1 mRNA and exert regulatory effects on BACE1 protein expression in cultured neuronal cells.

A microRNA (miR-532-5p) was identified as a target of RUNX3 mRNA sequences. miR-532-5p expression was shown to be significantly up-regulated in melanoma lines and metastatic melanoma tumors relative to normal melanocytes and primary melanomas, respectively. To investigate the relation between RUNX3 and miR-532-5p, anti-miR-532-5p was transfected into melanoma lines. Inhibition of miR-532-5p up-regulated both RUNX3 mRNA and protein expression.CONCLUSIONS: RUNX3 is down-regulated during melanoma progression and miR-532-5p is a regulatory factor of RUNX3 expression."

EZH2, the catalytic subunit of PRC2, enhances tumorigenesis and is commonly overexpressed in several types of cancer. Our microRNA profiling of bladder transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) patient samples revealed that microRNA-101 (miR-101) is down-regulated in TCC, and we showed that miR-101 inhibits cell proliferation and colony formation in TCC cell lines. Furthermore, our results confirm that miR-101 directly represses EZH2 and stable EZH2 knockdowns in TCC cell lines create a similar growth suppressive phenotype. This suggests that abnormal down-regulation of miR-101 could lead to the overexpression of EZH2 frequently seen in cancer.

Recent evidence suggest that microRNA (miRNA) pathways, implicated in gene transcriptional control, could be involved in the development of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). We therefore investigated whether miRNAs could participate in the regulation of APP gene expression. We show that miRNAs belonging to the miR-20a family (that is, miR-20a, miR-17-5p and miR-106b) could regulate APP expression in vitro and at the endogenous level in neuronal cell lines. A tight correlation between these miRNAs and APP was found during brain development and in differentiating neurons. We thus identify miRNAs as novel endogenous regulators of APP expression, suggesting that variations in miRNA expression could contribute to changes in APP expression in the brain during development and disease. This possibility is further corroborated by the observation that a statistically significant decrease in miR-106b expression was found in sporadic AD patients."	APP	unknown	2009	19110058	causal

Down-regulation of HES1 expression by miR-199b-5p negatively regulates the proliferation rate and anchorage-independent growth of MB cells. MiR-199b-5p over-expression blocks expression of several cancer stem-cell genes, impairs the engrafting potential of MB cells in the cerebellum of athymic/nude mice, and of particular interest, decreases the MB stem-cell-like (CD133+) subpopulation of cells. In our analysis of 61 patients with MB, the expression of miR-199b-5p in the non-metastatic cases was significantly higher than in the metastatic cases (P = 0.001). Correlation with survival for these patients with high levels of miR-199b expression showed a positive trend to better overall survival than for the low-expressing patients. These data showing the down-regulation of miR-199b-5p in metastatic MBs suggest a potential silencing mechanism through epigenetic or genetic alterations. Upon induction of de-methylation using 5-aza-deoxycytidine, lower miR-199b-5p expression was seen in a panel of MB cell lines, supported an epigenetic mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, two cell lines (Med8a and UW228) showed significant up-regulation of miR-199b-5p upon treatment. Infection with MB cells in an induced xenograft model in the mouse cerebellum and the use of an adenovirus carrying miR-199b-5p indicate a clinical benefit through this negative influence of miR-199b-5p on tumor growth and on the subset of MB stem-cell-like cells, providing further proof of concept."

hsa-miR-328	3459	breast cancer	up-regulated	"northern blot, qRT-PCR etc"	"Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) is a molecular determinant of pharmacokinetic properties of many drugs in humans. To understand posttranscriptional regulation of ABCG2 and role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in drug disposition, we found that microRNA-328 (miR-328) might readily target the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of ABCG2 when considering target-site accessibility. We then noted an inverse relation between the levels of miR-328 and ABCG2 in MCF-7 and MCF-7/MX100 breast cancer cells, and the fact that miR-328 levels could be rescued in MCF-7/MX100 cells transfected with miR-328 plasmid. Luciferase reporter assays showed that ABCG2 3'-UTR-luciferase activity was decreased over 50% in MCF-7/MX100 cells after transfected with miR-328 plasmid, the activity was increased over 100% in MCF-7 cells transfected with a miR-328 antagomir, and disruption of miR-328 response element within ABCG2 3'-UTR led to a 3-fold increase in luciferase activity. Furthermore, the level of ABCG2 protein was down-regulated when miR-328 was over-expressed, and the level was up-regulated when miR-328 was inhibited by selective antagomir. Altered ABCG2 protein expression was associated with significantly declined or elevated levels of ABCG2 3'-UTR and coding sequence mRNAs, suggesting possible involvement of the mechanism of mRNA cleavage. Lastly, miR-328-directed down-regulation of ABCG2 expression in MCF-7/MX100 cells resulted in an increased mitoxantrone sensitivity, as manifested by a significantly lower IC50 value (2.46 +/- 1.64 microM) when compared to the control (151 +/- 32 microM). Together, these findings suggest that miR-328 targets ABCG2 3'-UTR and consequently, controls ABCG2 protein expression and influences drug disposition in human breast cancer cells."

hsa-miR-346	5419	schizophrenia	down-regulated	"northern blot, qRT-PCR etc"	"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a neuropsychiatric disorder that affects about 1% of the adult population. Numerous genes have been implicated in SZ susceptibility. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small RNA molecules that regulate the translation of mRNAs via interactions with their 3' untranslated regions. Identification of known miRNA targets on all human genes indicated that miRNA-346 targets SZ susceptibility genes listed in the SchizophreniaGene database twice as frequently as expected relative to other genes in the genome. The gene encoding this miRNA, miR-346, is located in intron 2 of the glutamate receptor ionotropic delta 1 (GRID1) gene, which has been previously implicated in SZ susceptibility. We used quantitative real-time PCR to determine the expression levels of miR-346 and GRID1 using brain RNA samples from the Stanley Array Collection, Stanley Medical Research Institute. Expression of both miR-346 and GRID1 is lower in SZ patients than that in normal controls (P=0.017 and 0.086, respectively). However, the expression of miR-346 and GRID1 is less correlated in SZ patients than in bipolar patients or in normal controls.

Down-regulation of miR-34a expression was highly significant in 19 of 25 (76%) human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues and associated with the metastasis and invasion of tumors. Furthermore, resected normal/tumor tissues of 25 HCC patients demonstrated an inverse correlation between miR-34a and c-Met-protein. In HepG2 cells, ectopic expression of miR-34a potently inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion in a c-Met-dependent manner. miR-34a directly targeted c-Met and reduced both mRNA and protein levels of c-Met; thus, decreased c-Met-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2).

Furthermore, the introduction of miR-34a downregulated phosphorylated Akt and cell cycle-related proteins.

A series of miRNAs that target CREB were identified. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that miR-34b was expressed significantly less in myeloid cell lines, previously known for high CREB protein levels. Exogenous miR-34b expression was induced, and results revealed a direct interaction with the CREB 3'-untranslated region, with the consequent reduction of the CREB protein levels in vitro. miR-34b restored expression caused cell cycle abnormalities, reduced anchorage-independent growth, and altered CREB target gene expression, suggesting its suppressor potential. Using reverse-phase protein array, CREB target proteins (BCL-2, cyclin A1, cyclin B1, cyclin D, nuclear factor-kappaB, Janus-activated kinase 1, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), as well as many downstream protein kinases and cell survival signaling pathways (AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin and extracellular signal-regulated kinase) usually elicited by CREB, were observed to have decreased. The miR-34b/miR-34c promoter was shown to be methylated in the leukemia cell lines used. This epigenetic regulation should control the observed miR-34b expression levels to maintain the CREB protein overexpressed. In addition, the inverse correlation between miR-34b and CREB expression was found in a cohort of 78 pediatric patients at diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, supporting this relationship in vivo.

However, the mechanism by which HDACs become overexpressed in human cancers remains somewhat of a mystery. In this study, we investigated the expression and functional significance of miR-449a in prostate cancer cells. Using real-time PCR, we found that miR-449a is downregulated in prostate cancer tissues relative to patient-matched control tissue. Introduction of miR-449a into PC-3 prostate cancer cells resulted in cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis and a senescent-like phenotype. In silico analysis of 3'-UTR regions identified a number of genes involved in cell-cycle regulation as putative targets of miR-449a. Using a luciferase 3'-UTR reporter system, we established that HDAC-1 (histone deacetylase 1), a gene that is frequently overexpressed in many types of cancer, is a direct target of miR-449a. Further, our data indicate that miR-449a regulates cell growth and viability in part by repressing the expression of HDAC-1 in prostate cancer cells.

To investigate the functional role of these miRNAs in ATC cells, ARO and FRO cells were transfected with miRNA inhibitors, antisense oligonucleotides containing locked nucleic acids. Suppression of miR-17-3p caused complete growth arrest, presumably due to caspase activation resulting in apoptosis. MiR-17-5p or miR-19a inhibitor also induced strong growth reduction, but only miR-17-5p inhibitor led to cellular senescence. On the other hand, miR-18a inhibitor only moderately attenuated the cell growth. Thus, we have clarified functional differences among the members of the cluster in ATC cells.

Furthermore, reconstitution of hsa-miR-342 in the colorectal cancer cell line HT-29 induced apoptosis, suggesting that this microRNA could function as a proapoptotic tumor suppressor.

Conversely, depletion of miR-1 facilitated N417 cell growth with concomitant elevation of these targets. Further, ectopic miR-1 induced apoptosis in A549 cells in response to the potent anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOXR).

Up-regulation of miRNA-146a coupled to down-regulation of CFH was observed in AD brain and in IL-1ss, Ass42 and/or oxidatively-stressed human neural (HN) cells in primary culture. Transfection of HN cells using an NF-kB-containing pre-miRNA-146a promoter-luciferase reporter construct in stressed HN cells showed significant up-regulation of luciferase activity that paralleled decreases in CFH gene expression. Treatment of stressed HN cells with the NF-kB inhibitors pyrollidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) or the resveratrol analog CAY10512 abrogated this response. Incubation of an antisense oligonucleotide to miRNA-146a (anti-miRNA-146a; AM146a) was found to restore CFH expression levels. These data indicate that NF-kB-sensitive miRNA-146a-mediated modulation of CFH gene expression may in part regulate an inflammatory response in AD brain and in stressed HN cell models of AD, and illustrates the potential for anti-miRNAs as an effective therapeutic strategy against pathogenic inflammatory signaling."

To determine the mechanism by which miR-521 modulates radiation sensitivity we measured the expression levels of one of its predicted target protein, Cockayne syndrome protein A (CSA). CSA is a DNA repair protein, and its levels correlated inversely with the levels of miR-521. Radiation treatment downregulated the levels of miR-521 and upregulated CSA protein. Similarly, ectopic inhibition of miR-521 resulted in increased CSA protein levels. Therefore by altering the levels of CSA protein, miR-521 sensitized prostate cancer cells to radiation treatment.

Here we show distinct expression of a panel of miRNAs between ERalpha-positive and ERalpha-negative breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Of the elevated miRNAs in ERalpha-negative cells, miR-221 and miR-222 directly interact with the 3'-untranslated region of ERalpha. Ectopic expression of miR-221 and miR-222 in MCF-7 and T47D cells resulted in a decrease in expression of ERalpha protein but not mRNA, whereas knockdown of miR-221 and miR-222 partially restored ERalpha in ERalpha protein-negative/mRNA-positive cells. Notably, miR-221- and/or miR-222-transfected MCF-7 and T47D cells became resistant to tamoxifen compared with vector-treated cells. Furthermore, knockdown of miR-221 and/or miR-222 sensitized MDA-MB-468 cells to tamoxifen-induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis. These findings indicate that miR-221 and miR-222 play a significant role in the regulation of ERalpha expression at the protein level and could be potential targets for restoring ERalpha expression and responding to antiestrogen therapy in a subset of breast cancers."

hsa-miR-510	3459	breast cancer	up-regulated	"Northern blot, qRT-PCR etc"	"Prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF) is an ETS transcription factor expressed in normal tissues with high epithelial cell content and noninvasive breast cancer cells. A putative tumor suppressor PDEF protein expression is often lost during progression to a more invasive phenotype. Interestingly, PDEF mRNA has been found to be retained or even overexpressed in the absence of protein; however, the mechanisms for this remain to be elucidated. This study identifies two microRNAs (miRNA) that directly act on and repress PDEF mRNA translation, leading to the loss of PDEF protein expression and the gain of phenotypes associated with invasive cells. In addition, we show that these miRNAs are elevated in human breast tumor samples. Together, these data describe a mechanism of regulation that explains, for the first time, the lack of correlation between PDEF mRNA and protein levels, providing insight into the underexplored role of posttranscriptional regulation and how this contributes to dysregulated protein expression in cancer. These observations have critical implications for therapeutically targeting miRNAs that contribute to cancer progression."	PDEF	unknown	2008	18922924	Causal
hsa-miR-7	3459	breast cancer	down-regulated	"Northern blot, qRT-PCR etc"	"We show that miR-7 inhibits p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) expression, a widely up-regulated signaling kinase in multiple human cancers, by targeting the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of Pak1 mRNA. We noticed an inverse correlation between the levels of endogenous miR-7 and Pak1 expression in human cancer cells. We discovered that endogenous miR-7 expression is positively regulated by a homeodomain transcription factor, HoxD10, the loss of which leads to an increased invasiveness. HoxD10 directly interacts with the miR-7 chromatin. Accordingly, the levels of Pak1 protein are progressively up-regulated whereas those of miR-7 and its upstream activator HoxD10 are progressively down-regulated in a cellular model of breast cancer progression from low to highly invasive phenotypes. Furthermore, HoxD10 expression in highly invasive breast cancer cells resulted in an increased miR-7 expression but reduced Pak1 3'-UTR-luciferase activity and reduced Pak1 protein. Finally, we show that miR-7 introduction inhibits the motility, invasiveness, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenic potential of highly invasive breast cancer cells. Collectively, these findings establish for the first time that Pak1 is a target of miR-7 and that HoxD10 plays a regulatory role in modifying the expression of miR-7."

Podocyte pathology included effacement, vacuolization, and hypertrophy with crescent formation. Despite normal expression of WT1, podocytes underwent dedifferentiation, exemplified by cytoskeletal disruption with early transcriptional downregulation of synaptopodin. These abnormalities differed from Cd2ap(-/-) mice, indicating they were not a general consequence of glomerular disease. Glomerular labeling of ezrin, moesin, and gelsolin was altered at 3 wk, but expression of nestin and alpha-actinin was unchanged. Abnormal cell proliferation or apoptosis was not responsible for the glomerular injury. Mutant podocytes were incapable of synthesizing mature miRNA, as revealed by their loss of miR-30a. In contrast, expression of glomerular endothelial and mesangial cell miRNAs (miR-126 and miR-145, respectively) was unchanged.

To investigate the functional role of these miRNAs in ATC cells, ARO and FRO cells were transfected with miRNA inhibitors, antisense oligonucleotides containing locked nucleic acids. Suppression of miR-17-3p caused complete growth arrest, presumably due to caspase activation resulting in apoptosis.
